# Fridge to Table

A web application for the age-old question - "what should I make for `input mealtime` today?"

## Description

Ever been in this situation? It’s mealtime - you make your way to the kitchen, opening the fridge door and staring at the various ingredients available but still thinking "I have nothing to eat!"
Facing this problem countless times (especially while working from home), I wanted to have one less decision to worry about - leading me to create "Fridge to Table" for my bootcamp project.


### Technologies Used
- React.js
- Material UI
- Ajax (fetch) for API

### Who Should Use Fridge to Table
Anyone who:
- can't decide what to cook
- wants to plan their recipes for the week
- just wants to find new, interesting recipes

### User Stories

A user should be able to:

- Navigate using the navigation bar (Home and Recipes)
- In Recipes, type in their ingredients and/or select a preferred cuisine and/or select their meal type
- Browse through recipes provided and pick the recipe they want
- View the full information and instructions of the selected recipe
- Go back to the same page they were on after browsing full recipe

## Planning and Development Process

1. Getting Data
    - First step was to find an API that was suitable to what I wanted, as well as what data to extract from the API (spoonacular has _lots_ of data)
2. Planning the User Journey
    - Next was thinking through the user journey and decision process
3. Deciding the Data Flow
    - Following that, was to decide how to configure the data to display the relevant information at the relevant pages
4. Adding styling
    - Making it look more presentable with Material UI
5. Clean-up
    - Did a bit of refactoring to make the code neater


### Problem-Solving Strategy

Hair-pulling, watching youtube tutorials, breaking down the problem (_what am I trying to solve here, what is the outcome I hope to achieve_),  rubberducking with peers and seeking help from my instructor.


### Add-ons/Improvements in the future

- Empty input after clicking button
- Save your favourite recipes
- Multiple select for cuisine and type
- Better refactoring
- Unfortunately, the API delivers a few kinks with the ingredients - will need a more suitable API in future
